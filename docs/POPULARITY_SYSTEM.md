# Popularity-Based Drink Recommendations

## Overview
The drink wizard now includes a sophisticated popularity system that tracks user preferences and boosts popular drinks in recommendations.

## How It Works

### 1. Like Tracking
- Users can like/unlike drinks in the wizard results
- Each like is stored with:
  - Anonymous session ID
  - Drink ID
  - Timestamp
  - Unique constraint prevents duplicate likes

### 2. Popularity Scoring
The matching algorithm includes a popularity bonus:
- **Max Points**: 10 points
- **Calculation**: `Math.min(10, Math.floor(likeCount / 2))`
- **Thresholds**:
  - 5+ likes: "üëç Well-liked"
  - 10+ likes: "‚≠ê Popular choice"
  - 20+ likes: "üî• Crowd favorite!"

### 3. Integration with Matching Algorithm
Popular drinks get boosted in the wizard results based on:
- User preferences (flavor, strength, occasion, etc.)
- Weather conditions
- Happy hour specials
- **Popularity bonus** (new!)

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Like counts update optimistically in the UI
- Popular drinks database is queried on each recommendation
- Analytics dashboard shows real-time popularity trends

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Likes table
CREATE TABLE drink_likes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  drink_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(session_id, drink_id)
);

-- Analytics view
CREATE VIEW popular_drinks AS
SELECT 
  drink_id,
  COUNT(*) as like_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as unique_users
FROM drink_likes
GROUP BY drink_id
ORDER BY like_count DESC;
```

## API Endpoints
